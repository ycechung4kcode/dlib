            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object represents a deep neural network.  In particular, it is
                the simplified interface through which layer objects interact with their
                subnetworks.  A layer's two important tasks are to (1) take outputs from its
                subnetwork and forward propagate them though itself and (2) to backwards
                propagate an error gradient through itself and onto its subnetwork.
                The idea of a subnetwork is illustrated in the following diagram:

                  +---------------------------------------------------------+
                  | loss <-- layer1 <-- layer2 <-- ... <-- layern <-- input |
                  +---------------------------------------------------------+
                                      ^                            ^
                                      \__ subnetwork for layer1 __/

                Therefore, by "subnetwork" we mean the part of the network closer to the
                input.

    {
        /*!
            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                Each layer in a deep neural network can be thought of as a function,
                f(data,parameters), that takes in a data tensor, some parameters, and
                produces an output tensor.  You create an entire deep network by composing
                these functions.  Importantly, you are able to use a wide range of
                different functions to accommodate the task you are trying to accomplish.
                Therefore, dlib includes a number of common layer types but if you want to
                define your own then you simply implement a class with the same interface
                as EXAMPLE_LAYER_.

                Note that there is no dlib::EXAMPLE_LAYER_ type.  It is shown here purely
                to document the interface that a layer object must implement.

                The central work of defining a layer is implementing the forward and backward
                methods.  When you do this you have three options:
                    - Implement the forward() and backward() methods according to the
                      specification shown below.  Do not implement forward_inplace() and
                      backward_inplace().
                    - Implement the forward() and backward() methods according to the
                      specification shown below, except exclude the computed_output
                      parameter from backward().  Doing this will allow dlib to make some
                      layers execute in-place and therefore run a little faster and use
                      less memory. Do not implement forward_inplace() and
                      backward_inplace().
                    - Implement the forward_inplace() and backward_inplace() methods
                      according to the specification shown below.  Do not implement
                      forward() and backward().  These in-place methods allow some types of
                      layers to be implemented more efficiently.

                - Constructs this object from item.  This form of constructor is optional
                  but it allows you to provide a conversion from one layer type to another.
                  For example, the following code is valid only if my_layer2 can be
                  constructed from my_layer1:
                    relu<fc<my_layer1<fc<input<matrix<float>>>>>> my_dnn1;
                    relu<fc<my_layer2<fc<input<matrix<float>>>>>> my_dnn2(my_dnn1);
                  This kind of pattern is useful if you want to use one type of layer
                  during training but a different type of layer during testing since it
                  allows you to easily convert between related deep neural network types.
